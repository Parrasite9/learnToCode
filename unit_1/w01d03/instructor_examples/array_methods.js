//1. index of -The indexOf() method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.
//2. push - The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
//3. pop - The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array.
//4. reverse - The reverse() method reverses an array in place and returns the reference to the same array, the first array element now becoming the last, and the last array element becoming the first. In other words, elements order in the array will be turned towards the direction opposite to that previously stated.
//5. unshift - The unshift() method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.
//6. shift - The shift() method removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. This method changes the length of the array.
//7. join - The join() method creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array (or an array-like object), separated by commas or a specified separator string. If the array has only one item, then that item will be returned without using the separator.
//8. includes - The includes() method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false as appropriate.
//9. slice - The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.
//10. splice - The splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place. To access part of an array without modifying it.
//11. sort - The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the reference to the same array, now sorted. The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values.
